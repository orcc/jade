The Just-In-Time Adaptive Decoder Engine (Jade) project as developped a new dynamic decoder, fully compliant with MPEG RVC paradigm and based on the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM).
The Jade executable can dynamically instantiate several RVC decoder descriptions produced by the LLVM back-end of Orcc.
The JadeToolBox is an executable allowing an optimized generation of a proprietary Video Tool Library.

Reader is invited to go to : http://orcc.sourceforge.net for finding more information about Jade.


The Jade project is structured as follow :
- src contains the source of the Jade project
- build the compiled tools for several operating systems (Windows, Linux and Mac Os)
- doc contains all the documentation of the src project
- VTL is the folder where the Video Tool Library as normalized in MPEG-C must be set.

The use of Jade is detailled in the enclosed COMMAND file.

The compilation of this project requires the following libraries:
- SDL-1.2.14 (http://www.libsdl.org)
- LLVM 2.9 (http://llvm.org)

The project is based on the Cross-platform Make CMake (at least 2.6), which can be found at http://www.cmake.org.

If you are using Visual Studio 2010, 2008 or 2005, the two first libraries can be found in runtime folder. Simply run cmake.bat to automatically set environment variables.

More information about Jade compilation can be found at http://orcc.sourceforge.net/drupal/?q=CompileJade.
